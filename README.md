# Data Structures and Algorithms
A university project which required me to propose, justify and implement a suitable solution for a given specification. I designed this program using an efficient and suitable data structure that met the specification's requirements, overcoming the current issue.

In addition to this program, a written report was required to justify and explain the advantages of my chosen data structure.
Originally, this project was stored locally. I have chosen to save this project remotely to strengthen my portfolio and demonstrate my understanding and quality of work.
